# Golf Distance Calculator

A professional golf distance calculator built with Next.js that accounts for weather conditions and supports multiple player profiles.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Distance Calculations
- **Temperature Effects**: Adjusts for air density changes
- **Wind Conditions**: Headwind, tailwind, and crosswind calculations
- **Green Conditions**: Soft, medium, and firm green rollout
- **Rain Impact**: Light, moderate, and heavy rain effects on carry and rollout
- **Club-Specific Rollout**: Each club has realistic rollout characteristics

### ðŸ‘¥ Player Profiles
- **Multiple Players**: Create and save profiles for different golfers
- **Custom Yardages**: Each player can input their personal distances
- **Persistent Storage**: Data saved in browser cookies
- **Default Values**: Comes with baseline yardages that can be customized

### ðŸ“± Mobile Friendly
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **Touch Optimized**: Large touch targets and smooth scrolling
- **Horizontal Scroll**: Table scrolls smoothly on mobile devices

## How to Use

### Calculator Tab
1. **Set Conditions**: Enter temperature, wind direction/speed, green conditions, and rain
2. **Calculate**: Click "Calculate All Distances" to see results for all clubs
3. **Read Results**: View carry distance, rollout, and final ball position

### Player Settings Tab

3. **Save Changes**: Input your personal distances and save
4. **Switch Players**: Load different player profiles from the saved list

## Club Data Structure

Each club includes:
- **Baseline distances** (carry and total)
- **Calm 17Â°C distances** (for temperature calibration)
- **Headwind 18 km/h distances** (for wind calculations)
- **Tailwind 18 km/h distances** (for wind calculations)
- **Rollout factor** (affects green rollout)

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework
- **React 19** - UI library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **JavaScript** - No TypeScript for simplicity
- **Browser Cookies** - Data persistence
