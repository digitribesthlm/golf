4. Name it: `golf`
5. Description: `Golf distance calculator with weather conditions and player profiles`
6. Make it **Public** (so others can see and contribute)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

Copy and run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/golf
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/golf.git
